# Multiplayer BlackJack
**C++**

A simplified multiplayer version of BlackJack that follows the traditional rules of the game. 

## Purpose
The goal of this project was to program a simplified version of blackjack in which two players can play against each other. The program functions as a turn based 
game. The point tracking system was designed to follow the standard blackjack rules and the specialty cards, such as aces, king, and queen, follow a similar pattern.

## How It Works
1. Welcome Screen
    - When starting a new game the players are greeted with a welcome message and initial player scores. The first player is prompted to choose the desired
      number of playing cards.

1. Player Cards
    - The dealer randomly assigns cards to the player and the first player is prompted if they'd like an additional card. The process is repeated for the second player.

1. Final Results
    - The player's scored are summed up and their final scores are posted. The program determines the winner based on blackjack logic and the winner is announced.

## What I Learned
I learned how to implement game logic into a scoring system to determine the winner of the game. I also learned how to implement multi user input into my program 
and to use conditionals to expand the program when needed.
